## FBX Debugger project

just a sandbox for trying some stuff out.

## Notes

This project used the FBX sdk - due to file size, you'll need to grab the FBX sdk yourself and put it into extern/fbx.
I've placed that library here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e3wGSMajOVD42VWAPAWmcXdrEfkdcaKo/view?usp=sharing

Note that I've already got the includes here - you really only need the lib folder.
